## Kung Pao Beef over Cauliflower Rice
##### 07-29-2019
Tonight, for dinner I ate leftover Chinese food from last night. I ate kung pao beef which contains beef, peanuts, celery and bamboo shoots in a spicy sauce. I ate the beef on top of store-bought cauliflower rice which I prepared from a freezer bag. We rarely eat out, however, we were returning from a weekend trip and did not have many groceries at home. 

The kung pao sauce is made from Szechuan peppers, garlic, ginger and soy. There is usually some variety in how this dish is prepared at different restaurants. This preparation was not as spicy and flavorful as some I have had in the past, however, the portion size I received was enough food for 2 large dinners. I prepared the cauliflower rice on the stovetop in a separate pan until hot, and most of the moisture had evaporated. I added quite a bit of sriracha for flavor and heat. 

I ate this meal on the couch in front of the television as I usually do on most nights. I usually eat Chinese food with chopsticks, and it is a comfort food for me. I tried to make it healthier by substituting the cauliflower rice since I am trying to increase my vegetable intake. Overall this was a nice filling meal and it did not cost very much money and it was easy to put together. It was also nice to not have to cook and do many dishes since I usually cook dinner on the nights I am home.
