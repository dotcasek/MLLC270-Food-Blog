## Turkey Sandwich with Swiss Cheese
##### 07-30-2019
Today for lunch I ate a turkey sandwich with swiss cheese and mustard. This is what I have pretty much every weekday for lunch. I like to make a sandwich for myself for lunch since I do not always enjoy buying lunch at work or school. It costs less than buying a sandwich at the cafeteria, and I am able to control the quality of ingredients as well as what I put inside the sandwich. Instead of buying a premade sandwich for 6-8 dollars I can buy ingredients for a little over 10-15 dollars and have sandwiches for at least a week. I would say the sandwich is a pretty typical lunch in the United States. 

Today I had turkey and swiss, but sometimes I decide to buy other sliced cheeses and deli meats to mix things up a bit. In addition to turkey, I enjoy ham, chicken salad, egg salad, tuna salad, roast beef, and salami. Choosing from a variety of options make eating the same sandwich every day seem a bit less boring and I am able to try new combinations of meat and cheese. I prepare the sandwich in the morning and keep it in an insulated bag with an ice pack that way it stays a cool temperature. 

I generally eat while sitting at my desk at work. There is a lot of space and there is a small kitchen with water and napkins etc. I recently started using a reusable zip lock bag. Previously I have used disposable sandwich bags, and I felt this would be less wasteful.

## Kung Pao Beef over Cauliflower Rice
##### 07-29-2019
Tonight, for dinner I ate leftover Chinese food from last night. I ate kung pao beef which contains beef, peanuts, celery and bamboo shoots in a spicy sauce. I ate the beef on top of store-bought cauliflower rice which I prepared from a freezer bag. We rarely eat out, however, we were returning from a weekend trip and did not have many groceries at home. 

The kung pao sauce is made from Szechuan peppers, garlic, ginger and soy. There is usually some variety in how this dish is prepared at different restaurants. This preparation was not as spicy and flavorful as some I have had in the past, however, the portion size I received was enough food for 2 large dinners. I prepared the cauliflower rice on the stovetop in a separate pan until hot, and most of the moisture had evaporated. I added quite a bit of sriracha for flavor and heat. 

I ate this meal on the couch in front of the television as I usually do on most nights. I usually eat Chinese food with chopsticks, and it is a comfort food for me. I tried to make it healthier by substituting the cauliflower rice since I am trying to increase my vegetable intake. Overall this was a nice filling meal and it did not cost very much money and it was easy to put together. It was also nice to not have to cook and do many dishes since I usually cook dinner on the nights I am home.
