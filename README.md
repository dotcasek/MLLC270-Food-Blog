# Kung Pao Beef over Cauliflower Rice

Tonight for dinner i ate leftover chineese food from last night. I ate kung pao beef which contains beef, peanuts, celery and bamboo shoots in a spicy sauce. I ate the beef on top of cauliflower rice which i prepared from freezer bag.

The kung pao sauce is made from schezuan peppers, garlic, ginger and soy
