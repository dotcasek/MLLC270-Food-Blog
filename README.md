## Summer Sausage and Polenta
##### 08-02-2019
Tonight, I went out for dinner. We went to a restaurant that I like called Deep Ellum. I have not been there in a long time, but I enjoyed going there in the past the food and bar is very good and it has a relaxed atmosphere. I ordered a cocktail called the Brooklyn cocktail. A traditional Manhattan has whiskey vermouth and bitters. This cocktail contained rye whiskey, house made picon, vermouths, maraschino liqueur, and bitters. The maraschino cherry liquor and the picon, which is an aperitif made from citrus, gives the drink a nice sweetness. The drink was diluted in ice and strained into a glass. I am not going to go into detail about how many of these I ordered on this night, but I will say they it was Friday night and they were very good. 

For an appetizer we ordered buffalo wings we were so hungry I forgot to take a picture but they were crispy and spicy and served with ranch and a carrot slaw. For a main course I ordered the ‘wurst plate’ ,which is their seasonal sausage I don’t know what type of sausage it was but it was very tasty. It was served on top of a cheesy polenta and topped with strips of summer squash. The main course is a seasonal dish for the summer, the flavors were light and incorporated in season vegetables such as the zucchini and summer squash. The polenta was also creamy and cheesy and complemented the dish well.

## Espresso
##### 08-01-2019
For breakfast today I just had an espresso. I do not usually eat breakfast during the week. I enjoy coffee but I recently purchased an espresso machine since I enjoy espresso as well. The machine itself is relatively cheap compared to some of the professional models but it does the job. I like my coffee to be rich and not watery tasting. This machine is adjustable to control the volume of water in each shot which I like. Since the espresso pods are premeasured it is helpful to get it the way I like it. I don’t usually add anything to the espresso in the morning and may have 2 if I am feeling the need for some extra caffeine. It us usually quicker to just take the shot of espresso rather than sip on coffee and it helps me get out the door faster in the morning. 

I also enjoy a cappuccino after work or on the weekends. Many of the espresso pods have Italian sounding names for the variety of different roasts available. There are also capsules called ‘lungo’ which I enjoy, they create a 4 oz espresso much like an americano. I usually make these when I want something more like a coffee, and brewed fresh it is great. I know Italy is well known for their coffee roasting and I like trying different roasts from all over the world, I can not really taste the subtle differences but I am working on it. I also heard that they sell lungo capsules at trader joes and would like to try those and see how they are since I believe they are about half the price.

## Chicen and Broccoli with Creamy Caper Sauce
##### 07-31-2019
Tonight for dinner I ate chicken breast with a creamy caper sauce and a side of broccoli. I subscribe to a meal delivery service and this is one of the recipes I received this week. I enjoy having meals delivered since it has given me some new ideas for dinner and ingredients. Everything I have gotten so far has been delicious. 

This meal consists of grilled chicken breast marinated in spices, I don’t remember the exact spices used in the marinate but It it contained poppy and sesame seeds and gave the chicken a nice flavor. The pan sauce was prepared by adding sun-dried tomatoes, capers, garlic, cream cheese, and a little water. 

Broccoli was roasted in the oven with parmesan cheese and kalamata olives and served on the side. I generally like to eat more than the portion they provide, so I supplemented this dish with a few extra broccoli crowns I had in the refrigerator. This made the meal a bit more filling. 

The flavors were nice, I enjoyed the creamy salty sauce along with the chicken and the pile of broccoli was very filling. This reminds me of something that could be served in Italy. For some reason the capers, olives and sundried tomato combination reminds me of the Mediterranean. 

I like meals like this during the week since they are healthy and easy to prepare. It also reduces the amount of grocery shopping I have to do so and time I have to spend creating a menu for the week. I am hoping that I can learn a few recipes and techniques that I can use in the future from this service.

## Turkey Sandwich with Swiss Cheese
##### 07-30-2019
Today for lunch I ate a turkey sandwich with swiss cheese and mustard. This is what I have pretty much every weekday for lunch. I like to make a sandwich for myself for lunch since I do not always enjoy buying lunch at work or school. It costs less than buying a sandwich at the cafeteria, and I am able to control the quality of ingredients as well as what I put inside the sandwich. Instead of buying a premade sandwich for 6-8 dollars I can buy ingredients for a little over 10-15 dollars and have sandwiches for at least a week. I would say the sandwich is a pretty typical lunch in the United States. 

Today I had turkey and swiss, but sometimes I decide to buy other sliced cheeses and deli meats to mix things up a bit. In addition to turkey, I enjoy ham, chicken salad, egg salad, tuna salad, roast beef, and salami. Choosing from a variety of options make eating the same sandwich every day seem a bit less boring and I am able to try new combinations of meat and cheese. I prepare the sandwich in the morning and keep it in an insulated bag with an ice pack that way it stays a cool temperature. 

I generally eat while sitting at my desk at work. There is a lot of space and there is a small kitchen with water and napkins etc. I recently started using a reusable zip lock bag. Previously I have used disposable sandwich bags, and I felt this would be less wasteful.

## Kung Pao Beef over Cauliflower Rice
##### 07-29-2019
Tonight, for dinner I ate leftover Chinese food from last night. I ate kung pao beef which contains beef, peanuts, celery and bamboo shoots in a spicy sauce. I ate the beef on top of store-bought cauliflower rice which I prepared from a freezer bag. We rarely eat out, however, we were returning from a weekend trip and did not have many groceries at home. 

The kung pao sauce is made from Szechuan peppers, garlic, ginger and soy. There is usually some variety in how this dish is prepared at different restaurants. This preparation was not as spicy and flavorful as some I have had in the past, however, the portion size I received was enough food for 2 large dinners. I prepared the cauliflower rice on the stovetop in a separate pan until hot, and most of the moisture had evaporated. I added quite a bit of sriracha for flavor and heat. 

I ate this meal on the couch in front of the television as I usually do on most nights. I usually eat Chinese food with chopsticks, and it is a comfort food for me. I tried to make it healthier by substituting the cauliflower rice since I am trying to increase my vegetable intake. Overall this was a nice filling meal and it did not cost very much money and it was easy to put together. It was also nice to not have to cook and do many dishes since I usually cook dinner on the nights I am home.
